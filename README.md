# Covid-tracker-CT
Covid tracker app for Connecticut

# App idea
This is an covid data visualization project. I currently plan to focus mostly on the Connecticut's covid data. I plan to use the publicly
covid dataset provided by google for this project. Some things I could visualize are: 

- Current number of cases by county
- Current number of beds available by county 
- State of vaccinations by county
- Death toll in county by month
